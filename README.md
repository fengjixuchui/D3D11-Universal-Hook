# Universal D3D11 Hook
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)
# Features
- Everything is ready for you, this is mostly used towards game hacking but you can use it for any purpose.
You can also simply implement Dear ImGui with this source code, just make sure you have all the nessecary files.
- Contains a present hook and a endscene hook for rendering stuff
- You can use WndProc for menu input or letting the program not receive input

## Thanks kiero for the librarys.
Anything makes a D3D hook project more simpiler with kieros libraries
- You can switch between multiple renderers
- You can choose between Detouring or using Minhooks
- Stays undetected for game cheat creators (Minhook libraries and mostly UD)
